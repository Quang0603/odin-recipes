    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 220C / 200C Fan / Gas Mark 7.</li>

      <li>
        Cook the macaroni until it’s a bit less done than normal – a couple of
        minutes less than you would usually do. The brand I use takes 10 minutes
        normally, so I give it 8 minutes for macaroni cheese.
      </li>

      <li>
        While the macaroni is cooking, make the cheese sauce. Melt the butter in
        a medium sized pan on a low heat. When the butter is foaming, add the
        flour and stir until it’s mixed in. Then keep cooking for 2 minutes,
        stirring frequently. It takes guts to do this. It looks like something
        is going to go wrong but it doesn’t!
      </li>

      <li>
        Very gradually add the milk, stirring constantly. Make sure each bit of
        milk is incorporated before adding the next bit. If you do this slowly
        on a very low heat, you should end up with a perfectly smooth cheese
        sauce with no lumps and no need to whisk. However, if it does go wrong
        for some reason, you can always use a whisk to beat out the lumps.
      </li>

      <li>
        When all the milk is incorporated, add the mustard, salt and pepper.
        (N.B. I use slightly salted butter, so I don’t add any extra salt here.)
        Then add half the cheese, stir to combine and turn off.
      </li>

      <li>
        When the pasta is done, drain it, retaining a little bit of the cooking
        water. Tip the pasta and a couple of tablespoonfuls of the cooking water
        into the cheese sauce and stir.
      </li>

      <li>
        Pour the macaroni cheese into a shallow ovenproof dish and sprinkle over
        the remaining cheese.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in the oven for 10 minutes. The top should be brown but the bottom
        should still be saucy and the macaroni should be perfectly cooked.
      </li>
